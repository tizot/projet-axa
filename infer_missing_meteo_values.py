#This script takes a csv where each row is composed of :
#- a date
#- a table composed of
#    - 100 entries, one for each departement from 0 to 99, each one composed of
#        - either a 0 if there is no data for this departement
#        - either a table of three entries composed of :
#             - temperature
#             - precipitations
#             - pressure
# If there is a 0 that means the value is missing

#It outputs a dict where the keys are time slots and the values are table of 300
# entries, of for each feature of the meteo in each departemnt
